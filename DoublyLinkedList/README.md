# Doubly Linked List in Javascript

1. Similar to Linked List with Extra link which links to previous node
2. Last Node points to null
3. Traverse in backward
4. More memory
5. Searching

## Why Linked List

1. Loose struture
2. Insert anything and anywhere
3. traversal = > itteration
4. scattered all over the memory
5. itteration is slower than arrays

## Big(O)

1. prepend => o(1)
2. append => o(1)
3. lookup => o(n) | little bit faster than Linked list
4. insert => o(n) | worst case
5. delete => o(n) | worst case

### Pointer

reference to memory to something else
